# PLSong
Where I attempt to print out a line of a poem for programming languages starting with each letter of the alphabet.

<h4>Here</h4>
Ada, Bash, D, Fortran, Go, Java, Lua, Python, Smalltalk

<h4>Deleted forever because I didn't want repeated letters of the alphabet</h4>
Lisp, Self

<h2>How this works</h2>
<p>On my end, I type into the command line</p>
<p>
./AlphabetSong.sh
</p>
<p>and it compiles and runs whatever code I have in alphabetical order by programming language.</p>

Unfortunately, this won't work anywhere else as the prerequisite is that you've installed all of the programming languages here, as well as set up whatever shell script you find does the job.

<h2>Why did you think this was a good idea?</h3>
<p>
I started this project in Spring '17 as a coping mechanism for Jay Freeman's Comparative Machine Language Morphology Course, also known as "Watch Jay type faster than you can read in 40 different programming languages from 6-9:30pm every Wednesday".  Prior to this, I only programmed in Java and C++.
</p>
<p>
Several of the programs here are designed to be as esoteric as possible, or to prove a point about a feature of the programming language or algorithm.  Efficiency was clearly not a priority.
</p>

The most poorly thought out part of this project was bootstrapping all of the above my UCSB CSIL account.  That didn't work once I hit the memory cap.
